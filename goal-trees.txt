antecedent matches then consequent adds or deletes data

data that appears ealier takes precedence

each pattern in an and clause will have the variables of the previous pattern

matching antecedent fires the rule

when a rule fires the system changes data and starts again from the first rule.

questions: antecedent matching matches but may not fire ( if it can't change the data)

where does data get added? I guess it doesn't matter
